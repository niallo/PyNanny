PyNanny is a process management framework. It has a mini HTTP server for
exposing statistics and settings. It is useful for:

- Auto-daemonization.
- Logging.
- Statistics gathering.
- Automatically restarting processes when they crash or fail a health check. Extrmely useful when you have production processes which are known to need restarts (e.g. due to bugs or JVM crashes)
- Configuration of child environments.
- Management of *groups* of processes - a single nanny process can monitor as
  many children as you like. This is very usefull if you have e.g. multiple
  copies of the same server running on separate ports, and want a single
  process to control them.

The core of Nanny is written in C and is production tested. PyNanny is a Python binding to combine the stable, perforamnt C with the extensibility and flexibility of Python.
